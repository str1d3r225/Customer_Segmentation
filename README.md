# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

This project applies KMeans clustering on mall customer data to segment customers based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. The aim is to help businesses understand different customer groups and make data-driven marketing decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Use the **Elbow method** and **Silhouette score** to determine optimal clusters
- Apply **KMeans Clustering**
- Create **dark-themed, visually striking plots** to present the results
- Perform **cluster profiling** for business insights

## 📊 Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, silhouette score)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (Dark theme visuals)
- Jupyter Notebook
